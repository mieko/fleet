The Graylog deb in the files/ directory is a meta-deb, only 2KB.  When
installed, it inserts an entry into sources.list, etc.  Because of its small
size, and it is the official way of installing Graylog, we'll leave it checked
into the fleet tree.  If it's deleted, the node will attempt to download it.
